# Generative AI Projects: Text-to-Image and Text-to-GIF

This repository contains Colab notebooks for generative AI projects focusing on converting text descriptions into images and GIFs using deep learning models.

## Projects Included

### 1. Text-to-Image Generation

- **Description:** Convert textual descriptions into corresponding images using a generative adversarial network (GAN).
- **Notebook:** `Gen_AI_txt_to_img.ipynb`
- **Dependencies:** PyTorch.

### 2. Text-to-GIF Generation

- **Description:** Generate GIF animations based on input text using sequence-to-sequence models and image generation techniques.
- **Notebook:** `Gen_AI_gif_gen.ipynb`
- **Dependencies:** PyTorch, image processing libraries.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JanithaB/Gen_AI.git
   cd Gen_AI

2. **Open and Run Notebooks:**
   - Open `text_to_image.ipynb` or `text_to_gif.ipynb` in Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute and generate outputs.

3. **Customization and Experimentation:**
   - Modify input text or parameters to observe different outputs.
   - Experiment with model architectures and hyperparameters for varied results.

4. **Feedback and Contributions:**
   - Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests.
   - For feedback or issues, please create an issue on GitHub.
